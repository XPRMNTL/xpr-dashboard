# Stuff I want to do

## Application
1. Configuration subscriptions (over time)
2. Configuration Push
3. API Documentation
4. UI Testing
5. Tie in business metrics
6. Variants other than true/false
7. Dynamic Environments
8. "Last Seen"
9. "Ready to Delete"
10. Version hashing and preflight checks
11. Fail-safe


## Ideas
* When scaling up an experiment, show diff change before "apply".
* Experiment change hooks
